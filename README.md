## Bot itself:

The bot recreates a famous chilean card game, it is really similar to the UNO cards haha.

## Rules

You'll have 3 types of cards

1. Hand cards: the first cards you have to play
2. Table cards: Cards that anyone can see
3. Hidden Cards: Cards that even you can't see, so, to play these card you have to empty your hand and table cards first
   In the Table are:
4. The deck: You'll take cards from here until your hand have 3 cards
5. The stack: where you'll put the cards you play
6. The other table cards
   Also some cards have effects
7. A: Is the card with the hightest value
8. 2: Is a wild card, you can play it anytime

10. 8: Skip the next player
11. 10: Burn the cards
12. J: Change the order
